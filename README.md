## Project Description

This repository contains code for a project analyzing shape variation in Littorina snails, using geometric morphometrics. We examined shell shape variation in two species of snails, *Littorina saxatilis* and *Littorina littorea*. We also compared resuts across two GM techniques - the traditional Procrustes method and a novel, growth-based method for shape characterization in shell-forming organisms. 

This research was conducted at the Tjarnö Marine Laboratory in Saltö, Sweden. It was the product of a 2-week research course, part of the International Master in Marine Biological Resources (IMBRSea). 

## Notes

1. Scripts in the data preparation folder regularly refer to an `images` sub-directory (under `data`). These have not been included here due to disk space, as this directory contained 180 high-resolution shell photographs. Anyone reproducing our analysis can directly use the tidied dataframes stored as CSV files in the `data` directory.

2. The summary report and presentation for this research can be found in the `docs` folder.
