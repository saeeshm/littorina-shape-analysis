Repository containing code for a geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in Littorina snails. The project aimed to analyze shell shape variation in two species of snails, Littorina saxatilis and Littorina littorea. We employed two methods for GM analysis - the traditional Procrustes method and a growth-based model for shape characterization. 

This code was part of a research project conducted at the Tjarn√∂ Marine Laboratory in Sweden, as part of the International Master in Marine Biological Resources.
